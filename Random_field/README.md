Gaussian Random field
=============================


A real-valued Gaussian (random) field or Gaussian (random) process to be a random field $f$ on a parameter set $T$ for which the (finite-dimensional) distributions of $(f_{t_{1}}, . . . , f_{t_{n}})$ are multivariate Gaussian for each $1 ≤ n < inf $ and each $(t_1, . . . , t_n) ∈ T_n.$
Since multivariate Gaussian distributions are determined by means and covariances, it is immediate that Gaussian random fields are determined by their mean and covariance functions, defined by:
