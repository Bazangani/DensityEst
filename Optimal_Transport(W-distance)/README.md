Wasserstein Variational Autoencoder
===============
Wasserstein Variational Autoencoder (W-VAE) is a generative model based on optimal transport (OT) and variational inference. The OT cost is a key to measure the distance between two probability distributions.

Wasserstein distance
---------------
Supose we have two distributions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ there are many ways to compute the distance between these two distributions such as KL divergence but there is some drawback with these kind of distances such as These distances ignore the underlying geometry of the space.
